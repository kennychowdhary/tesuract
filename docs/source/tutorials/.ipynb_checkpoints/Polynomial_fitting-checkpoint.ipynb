    "Since the regression test problem is in fact a sinusoidal function, let us try a higher order polynomial. Now, in order to create a five-dimensional polynomial using the tools already available in sklearn, we would have to create a one-dimensional monomial feature and then, in the simplest way, we can take a full tensor product of all interaction for each dimension. This means that if we have an 8th order polynomial in each of the five dimensions (each with 9 coefficient including the bias term), we would have $9^5 = 59,049$ coefficients to learn! This would lead to terms that have a total order (sum of exponents) of $8\\times5 = 40$, which is not ideal. We can limit the number of interaction terms by using Smolyak type expansions from uncertainty quantification, a.k.a., polynomial chaos expansions. In this case, if we want a total order of 8, then the total number of terms is only $1,287$. This is all done under the hood, and in a later tutorial we will explain what's going on. But for now, just trust me!"
