    "There are essentially three parameters to tune in the polynomial regression class. The first, and the most obvious, is the polynomial order, which has the keyword ``order`` in the constructor. The next is the type of polynomial interaction terms called ``mindex_type``. \"total_orer\" os the default, but an alternative is \"hyperbolic\" which has even fewer interaction terms which emphasizes more higher-order terms. In practice, this rarely leads to a better polynomial, but we can try it anyway. Last, but not least, there is the polynomial ``fit_type``, which determines the solver used to solve the least squares problem (Note even though polynomials are non-linear, the fitting boils down to a linear problem). This can be a bunch of different algorithms, but the three most widely used are 'linear', 'LassoCV', and 'ElasticNetCV'. \n",
